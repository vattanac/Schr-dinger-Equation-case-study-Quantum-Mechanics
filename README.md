## 🛡️ Self-Defence Clause (Academic Integrity)

This project is a **teaching resource**, not a shortcut. It is designed to build genuine understanding, not to be copied as coursework.

- All content is original and written from first principles.
- Mathematical derivations are shown step by step so readers can verify every result independently.
- The quiz is designed to expose gaps in understanding, not to provide answers to memorize.
- Readers are encouraged to work through derivations on paper, not just read them passively.

> ⚠️ If you are a student: use this resource to *understand* the material. Your exam will ask you to derive and apply — not to recall what a website said.

## 🖥️ Technical Notes

### HTML File
- **Zero dependencies** — pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- **No internet required** — works completely offline
- **No build step** — open directly in a browser

## 📐 Physics Accuracy Statement

All physics content in this resource is:

- Consistent with standard university-level quantum mechanics curricula (Griffiths, Shankar, Cohen-Tannoudji)
- Mathematically verified — derivations checked against known results
- Pedagogically simplified where necessary, but **never incorrect**
- Focused on the non-relativistic Schrödinger Equation (the Dirac equation for relativistic QM is out of scope)

If you find an error, discrepancy, or ambiguity, please flag it — accuracy matters in physics.
